### js-tachyons

A hand-tweaked build of the popular Functional CSS library
[Tachyons](https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons). Built in order to
facilitate code reuse between front-end projects. Intended for personal use, but
feel free to
[fork](https://github.com/jessestuart/js-tachyons#fork-destination-box) and
adapt to your own needs.

### Usage

To customize, edit `src/config/tachyons-definition.js` to your liking, then run:

```bash
$ yarn install -s
$ yarn run generate
```

You could then publish to NPM or a private registry (after editing
`package.json`) with `yarn publish`.
